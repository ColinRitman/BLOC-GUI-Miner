- *15 Dec 2018*
- [BLOC GUI Miner v0.0.3](https://github.com/furiousteam/BLOC-GUI-Miner/releases/tag/v0.0.3)

**Update details:**
First we would like to say a thank you to everyone for the great feedback we got from the previous release.
Some users reported us not to be able to start the BLOC GUI Miner on different systems.

We spent the last 3 days improving the miner and today we are happy to announce that the new version is fully compatible with all Windows (7 and 10), macOS (Sierra, High Sierra, Mojave) and Linux (14.04, 16.04, 18.04) operating system.

Also there was another problem with macOS users with the last build. We found out that XMR-STAK require Xcode and microhttpd dependencies and this is mandatory. Installing such dependencies can be challenging for some users. For this reason we switched the BLOC GUI Miner macOS version to XMRIG as it is included as a bundle so macOS users will not require to installing anything else beside the actual BLOC GUI Miner.

This version should work smoothly. Again we are looking for your feedbacks. This is the most important for us. Feedbacks keep us alive. Thank you.
